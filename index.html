                    <p>While our team is comprised of experienced and passionate individuals who possess extensive knowledge of the game, we have implemented a strict policy to avoid any potential conflict of interest or favoritism. As such, our administrators refrain from participating in gameplay activities, in order to maintain impartiality and ensure a fair and equitable experience for all our players.

                    <p>Maintaining fair and enjoyable gameplay is of utmost importance to us. Therefore, in the event that a player is suspected of violating our rules or engaging in cheating, we encourage the community to report such incidents using our official reporting channels. This can be done through:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rust's in-game F7 reporting system, which will immediately notify our administrators of any in-game reports. This report is also sent to Rusts EAC (Easy Anti Cheat) which may ban them for cheating.</li>
                        <li>Players can also submit a support ticket through our Discord server, ensuring that sufficient and concrete evidence is provided to substantiate any reports (screenshots, video proof etc.).</li>

                    <p>However, we would like to emphasise that repeated instances of excessive toxicity, even after being muted, will not be tolerated. In such cases, we reserve the right to issue a toxic behavior ban, should it be deemed necessary.

                    <p>We cannot provide a refund for any lost gear or items. Even with images or clip evidence, it is difficult for us to ascertain the exact nature and extent of the loss experienced by every player. As such, we do not offer refunds for lost items, as it would be unfair to those who have experienced similar losses but are unable to provide the same level of evidence. However there can be some case by case scenarios.</p>

To submit an appeal, please navigate to <a href="https://rustralia.com.au/discord" target="_blank">https://rustralia.com.au/discord</a> where you will be asked to verify your Steam and Discord accounts to confirm your identity.</p>
                    <p>Once verified, please proceed to the support-ticket channel on our Discord server and select the ‘Ban or Mute Appeal’ option. We request that all necessary and accurate information is provided to facilitate the appeals process. Please note that it may take up to 48 hours for us to respond to your appeal.</p>
