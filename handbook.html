                <h3 class="handbook-title">I WAS BANNED CAN I APPEAL IT</h3>
                <p class="handbook-detail">We understand that receiving a server ban can be a frustrating experience, and we strive to ensure that all bans are issued fairly. We provide an appeal system for players who wish to challenge a ban through our support ticket system on Discord. We request that all necessary and accurate information is provided to facilitate the appeals process. Please note that it may take up to 48 hours for us to respond to your appeal.</p>
				<p class="handbook-detail"><strong>What are the chances of me getting unbanned?</strong></p>
				<p class="dot-point">Only you can ask that to yourself and you will know your chances depending on what you have done</p>
				<p class="handbook-detail"><strong>Do you ban on assumption?</strong></p>
				<p class="dot-point">We will only ban if we have 100% evidence of cheating or for association to a cheater</p>
				<p class="handbook-detail"><strong>Can I please see the evidence you have against me?</strong></p>
				<p class="dot-point">We never share evidence outside of our staff team, the tools and strategies we use are confidential from any party outside of Rustralia.</p>
			</div>
            <div class="handbook-item">
                <h3 class="handbook-title">ASSOCIATION BANS</h3>
                <p class="handbook-detail">If you were banned for association please know this. You can appeal, however it does not mean we will accept your appeal, we may change how long the ban is but that is all.</p>
				<p class="dot-point"><strong>I was banned for association but I didnt know he was cheating or ban evading?</strong> If you were banned for association, you will have to serve your time, you can appeal it to see if you can get your time reduced however if it is denied then do not bother to make another ticket, it will get you ticket blocked.</p>
				<p class="dot-point"><strong>My team mate was EAC banned, will I get banned?</strong> Yes. An admin will determine the length of your ban once they have concluded their investigation.</p>
				<p class="dot-point"><strong>This player wasn't banned for association?</strong> If a player is banned for EAC ban evasion their team will not be banned only noted, please note somtimes a player will be banned for EAC ban evasion and then be back on the server. That means they were cleared by staff. If some people havent been banned for association it means they were also cleared by staff by having no clear involvement with the player, they will still be noted, staff are very thorough  with these investigations, these association bans can sometimes take a little bit to roll through.</p>
				<p class="handbook-detail">Association bans can vary in length depending on the severity of the offence and the proof we have. Repeat offenders will find themselves with an extended ban or a permanent ban.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="handbook-item">
                <h3 class="handbook-title">MUTES</h3>
                <p class="handbook-detail">There are many reasons you may be muted, you may have said a bad word and been automatically muted, you may have said something toxic, homophobic, sexist or plain bad, or you could have broken another rule from below. Mute lengths vary apart from auto mutes,<strong> DO NOT</strong> bother appealing an auto mute, it will be denied.</p>
				<p class="dot-point"><strong>I was muted for 30 days why? Can I appeal?</strong> You can however you will most likely only be told why you were muted with the appeal being turned down.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="handbook-item">
                <h3 class="handbook-title">RELEASING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION "DOXXING"</h3>
                <p class="handbook-detail">We take privacy very seriously and prohibit any form of doxxing or releasing of personal information of other players. This does not include images set as a display picture or publicly displayed information on Steam. We recommend removing any personal publicly displayed information from your Steam as everyone can see your profile (name, city country, etc,). The unauthorized disclosure of personal information can have serious consequences and may result in harm to the affected user/s. <strong>User who was doxxed can appeal a ban for a person who doxxed (example the "doxxer" said the users real name).</strong></p>
				<p class="handbook-detail">What do we class as doxxing?</p>
				<p class="dot-point">Saying another users first or last name with or without consent in voice or text (steam info ignored)</p>

			</div>
			<div class="handbook-item">
                <h3 class="handbook-title">TOXIC BEHAVIOR</h3>
                <p class="handbook-detail">We take a strong stance against the use of hateful language, racism and homophobia in our community and have implemented a protocol to ensure that all players adhere to this standard. As such, we may temporarily mute players who engage in the use of such language. Please note that all mutes have a specified duration and will be lifted automatically upon completion. Repeated instances of excessive toxicity, even after being muted, will not be tolerated. In such cases, we reserve the right to issue a ban, should it be deemed necessary.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="handbook-item">
                <h3 class="handbook-title">3RD PARTY APPLICATIONS</h3>
                <p class="handbook-detail">Utilising third-party applications to gain an unfair advantage in any context is strictly prohibited and will lead to a permanent ban on all Rustralia servers. Such illicit practices encompass but are not limited to cheating, scripts, and macros, which are considered flagrant violations of the rules and regulations by Facepunch. Please be advised that the use of unauthorised software determined by Facepunch undermines the integrity of the game, and is therefore not tolerated under any circumstances.</p>
				<p class="dot-point"><strong>Can I use my own crosshair?</strong> Yes, if you do not wish to use the in-game crosshair you can use an alternative crosshair on Steam.</p>

                <h3 class="handbook-title">PROMOTING CHEATS</h3>
                <p class="handbook-detail">We take a zero-tolerance stance towards the promotion of cheating, scripts, and/or macros on our servers new or old. Engaging in such behaviour can have serious consequences, including  a permanent ban from our servers and discord. In the event that a user is found to have promoted the past/current use of cheats, scripts, and/or macros, a ban may be issued.</p>

Our moderation team carefully considers the context and nature of the violation before determining the appropriate course of action.</p>

                <p class="handbook-detail">We take game exploits and bugs that have not been patched seriously on our servers. Abusing game exploits undermines the fairness and integrity of the game, and as such, users who engage in such behaviour may face a permanent ban from the servers. The severity of the violation will be assessed by our moderation team, and the appropriate action will be taken. It is important to report any exploits or bugs discovered to our team immediately to ensure that they can be addressed promptly. Failure to report an exploit and instead taking advantage of it is considered a violation of our rules and may lead to a permanent ban.</p>
